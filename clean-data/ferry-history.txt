HISTORICAL HIGHLIGHTS OF THE GUEMES ISLAND FERRY SYSTEM  



1890-1902: 
- W.C. Pyle establishes the first private ferry service between Anacortes and Guemes Island: the Lola, Capt. M.B. Miller. A launch, the Glide, also provides service. The U.S. Mail Steamer Buckeye, Capt. A. Newhall, includes Guemes Island on its Friday Harbor-Anacortes-Whatcom route. [2]
1902-1912: 
- The Sunny Jim, Capt. Harry Rickaby, is in service.
1912-1915: 
- The 35-passenger Elk, Capt. Harry Rickaby, is in service.
1915-1917: 
- The 60-passenger Elk II, Capt. Harry Rickaby, is in service.
1917-1959: 
- The Guemes, 86 tons and 48.6 feet in length, is in service. Capt. Bill Bessner takes over operation of the Guemes in 1920.
1959-1979: 
- The Almar is in service. Almar was built in 1947 on Puget Island in the Columbia River,[3] where it served until moving to the Anacortes-Guemes ferry route. Almar, with a capacity for nine vehicles, was not a true double-ender; the ferry had to be backed into the Anacortes slip, and large trucks could not be carried. Almar is reported to still be afloat in Alaska.[3]
1979–present: 
- The current vesel named Guemes is in service.

1962: 
- Skagit County purchased the M/V Almar and all ferry facilities and began full management of the ferry system .   
1978: 
- Skagit County began planning for a larger ferry vessel and related dock improvements.  
1979: 
- Skagit  County replaced the M/V Almar  with the newly constructed M/V Guemes, which currently serves Guemes Island with a capacity of approximately 21 vehicles and 99  passengers . The County also replaced the ferry docks and associated infrastructure .   
2005: 
- The M/V Guemes was re -powered with new engines and transmissions.   
2010: 
- Skagit County replaced the creosote dolphins at the Guemes Island landing with steel pilings, and replaced the four wing walls at the Anacortes and Guemes landings.   
- Skagit County built a new terminal bu ilding at the Anacortes landing.   
2011:
- Skagit County replaced the girders on both the Anacortes and Guemes Island docks 
and completed an asphalt overlay at the Anacortes terminal .   
2013:
- Skagit County hired Elliott Bay Design Group to prepare a ferry replacement plan for 
future replacement of the 37-year-old M/V Guemes.   
2014: 
- Skagit County replaced the five remaining creosote dolphins at the Anacortes landing 
with steel pilings.

- Skagit County replaced the creosote timber breakwater with a new vertical plastic 
timber wave wall. As of the completion of this project, February 29 , 2016, all creosote 
was eliminated from the Anacortes and Guemes Island ferry terminals.    
- Skagit County began researching all -electric propulsion technology as an option for a 
new vessel to replace the M/V G uemes . Art Anderson Associates , a naval architecture 
firm, completed a propulsion study which  determined that all -electric technology would 
be feasible for the route.    

2017:
- Skagit County hired Glosten, a naval architecture firm, for the design of a replacement 
vessel for the M/V Guemes. Concept design for the Ferry Replacement Project was 
complete December 31, 2017.  
2018:
- The County Road Administration Board (CRAB) approved Skagit County for $7.5 
million through the County Ferry Capital Improvement Program for the Ferry 
Replacement Project.  
- The Board of Skagit County Commissioners approved a ferry replacement surcharge 
effective August 1, 2018.   

2019  
- Skagit County b egan preliminary design of the new 28-vehicle electric ferry and shore -
side facilities .  
- The WA State Legislature approved 1.5 million in the capital budget to fund 
construction of the shore -side facilities for the new electric ferry.    
- The design to remove and replace three deteriorating girders at the Anacortes ferry 
terminal was completed and  is scheduled for construction in 2022 . 
 
2020  
- Preliminary design for the Ferry Replacement Project  was completed .  
- Washington State Department of Commerce awarded $989,521 for the shore side 
electrical systems and charging infrastructure for the Ferry Replacement Project.  
 
2021
- Washington State Legislature passed SHB 1502 authorizing counties pursuing electric ferries to use additional competitive bidding procedures for procurement and design  resulting in RCW 36.32.234 . 
- Skagit County Board of Commissioners approved Resolution R20210241 designating selection of the Electrical Systems Integrator for the Ferry Replacement Project.  
- The WA State Legislature approved $474,000  in the capital budget to fund construction of the shore -side facilities for the new electric ferry . 
 
2022  
- Washington State Legislature passed the Move Ahead WA Package (Substitute Senate Bill 5975) with the intent to award up to $14 million for vessel construction.  
- Contract design for the Ferry Replacement Project was 90% completed.  
- The three northeastern -most girders on the Anacortes dock were replaced due to saltwater intrusion.  
 
2023  
- The Move Ahead WA Package awarded $14 million for vessel construction; funds were obligated in October.  
- Vessel bid package was released September 14; bids were  due December 18.  The county’s highest bid for vessel construction was $24.4 million.  
- The shoreside electrical and terminal modifications projects reached 100% design.  
 
2024  
- During the legislative session, the state budget included $10 million for the construction of an electric vessel, pending the CCA (Climate Commitment Act) would not be repealed.  
- Following legislative session, Initiative 2117 was introduced, proposed to repeal the CCA  and possibly $14  million awarded in 2023 for the construction of an electric vessel.  
- The Board of Skagit County Commissioners elected to postpone further effort s on the ferry replacement program until the result of the election was known.  
- In November, Initiative 21 17 failed. The results of the election meant Skagit County retained $24 million for construction of the new electric ferry.  
- The Ferry Division budgeted for, and procured new modern, efficient diesel engines to replace 20 -year-old machinery and improve operational efficiency and reliability.
